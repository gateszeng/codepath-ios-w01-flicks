# Project 1 - *Flicks*

**Flicks** is a movies app using the [The Movie Database API](http://docs.themoviedb.apiary.io/#).

Time spent: **5.0** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

- [x] User can view a list of movies currently playing in theaters from The Movie Database.
- [x] Poster images are loaded using the UIImageView category in the AFNetworking library.
- [x] User sees a loading state while waiting for the movies API.
- [x] User can pull to refresh the movie list.

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [x] User sees an error message when there's a networking error.
- [ ] Movies are displayed using a CollectionView instead of a TableView.
- [x] User can search for a movie.
- [x] All images fade in as they are loading.
- [ ] Customize the UI.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!

Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):

1. I would like to see how the implement a collection view since I ran out of time to do so.
2. I would like to see how network requests are done to retrieve the information from the movie database.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
I was confused with the network request and the location in which to put my code to show the network error dialog.

Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):

1. I would like to discuss different ways of implementing the filter for the search bar.
2. I would like to discuss the proper conventions for location of functions and variables in swift.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
A challenge that I encountered was getting the tab views to work correctly, since I faced an error with unwrapping an optional.  After I resolved that error, the tab views only worked for "Now Playing" but not for "Top Rated". I then looke d back at my code and realized that the endpoint was not being set for "Top Rated" because I was referencing the nowPlayingNavigationController and not the topRatedNavigationController.
